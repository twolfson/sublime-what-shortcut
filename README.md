# sublime-what-shortcut

Discover what command/arguments correspond to shortcuts

**I started this but quickly realized the depth of the scope. I am considering this abandoned for now.**

## Getting Started
### Installation
This package is available under `what-shortcut` inside of [Package Control][], a [Sublime Text][] plugin that allows for easy management of other plugins.

[Sublime Text]: http://www.sublimetext.com/
[Package Control]: http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control

If you prefer the manual route, you can install the script via the following command in the Sublime Text terminal (``ctrl+` ``) which utilizes `git clone`.

```python
import os; path=sublime.packages_path(); (os.makedirs(path) if not os.path.exists(path) else None); window.run_command('exec', {'cmd': ['git', 'clone', 'https://github.com/twolfson/sublime-what-shortcut', 'what-shortcut'], 'working_dir': path})
```

Packages can be uninstalled via "Package Control: Remove Package" via the command pallete, `ctrl+shift+p` on Windows/Linux, `command+shift+p` on Mac.
